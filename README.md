# student-info

This repo is an exercise as a part of one2n's [Site Reliability Engineering BootCamp](https://playbook.one2n.in/sre-bootcamp). Here, we build a CRUD REST API to perform the following operations

- Add a new student
- Get all students
- Get a student with an Id
- Update existing student information
- Delete a student record
